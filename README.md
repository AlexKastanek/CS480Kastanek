# Example OpenGL Graphics Programs
## This is for use at the University of Nevada, Reno CS 480/680 Graphics Class
Any students in that class follow the instructions at [**Github Setup**](https://github.com/HPC-Vis/computer-graphics/wiki/Github-Setup) to begin. This is part of the first assignment in the class and necessary for turning in assignments throughout the semester.

Read through the Wiki on this repository to understand how each class works. This Wiki focuses on the code in PA1.

# Projects

## PA0: Triangle
This is a simple colored triangle on the screen. To run this project ```cd PA0``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA1: Spinning Cube
This is a cube that rotates in place on the screen. To run this project ```cd PA1``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA2: Interaction
This is a cube that rotates in place on the screen, and the direction of rotation can be changed by user input. To run this project ```cd PA2``` then follow the instruction in the README.md.

## PA3: Moon
Adding another cube that is parented to the original cube and can be rotated around its parent.

## PA4: Model Loading
This project can load any model as a .obj file along with its material as a .mtl file.

## PA5: Model Loading with Assimp
This project can load any model as a .obj file along with its material as a .mtl file. This uses the Assimp library to manage all loaded objects.

## PA6: Texture Loading with Assimp
This project can load any model as a .obj file along with a texture provided as some image file (.jpg, .png, etc.).

## PA7: Solar System
A simulation of a solar system

## PA8: Bullet
A small demonstration of the physics library Bullet.

## PA9: Lighting
A small demonstration of the physics library Bullet now with global lighting.

## PA10: Pinball
A recreation of the game Pinball with custom models, textures, lights, and physics.

## PA11: Shooting Gallery
A game featuring custom shaders to produce shadows, models, textures, lights, and physics.
